This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## what i want to archive 
- i want robust security for my erp application. which protect from everything from small to highe level hacker or any other trick, in short i want security like apple or google lavel
- second is user experinse of best for our security user should not strugle in doing work on my application
- best preforemese of all over my erp app and expirense 

## which technology i am using currently ?
- frontend - next.js and neccesery library , i am using javascript not typescript 
- backend - node.js with express 
- database - mongodb
(you can suggest me other tech which is align more with my archivement goal)

## currntly what i am doing 
- after user is valid at log in time i am creating access and refresh token
- i am storing both token in httpOnly also storing refresh token in database 
- next i have middleware.js for protecting all routes which check access token and verify by using JWT_ACCESS_SECRET in .env 
    and if it's valid it give access to /dashboard and other frontend routs 
- middleware.js run on all frontend route and check for access token and not valid then redirect to login page 
- i have axiosInstance.js file which have interceptors and call /refresh-token api when it got 401 error and 
- /refresh-token at backend check for validation of user and if user is authenticate create new access and refresh token and delete old refresh token 

## where i have problem 
- after login successfuly and getting token and all good user now at /dashbord or any other frontend routs 
- now when user only inrect with frontend not making any request at backend and then after 15 min access token expire and frontend middleware.js run and redirect to login page , this is main issue 

## what i can do and what problem i have for that 

1. check auth for every frontend route when it's mount or render 
- i can do check for auth for every page of frontend route when it's first render by requesting backend
- problem with this is too many request to backend , even user refresh front page 6-7 time and 6-7 request will be made to backend , so too many request is my consern, i don't know this is normal or i should do this or not 

2. check auth at login page 
- i can do when middleware.js redirect to login page i check for auth by making request for backend before rendreing frontend components and backend chek user have refresh token and have valid the create new access and refresh token and delete old refresh token and login page logic redirect to /dashbord if user is valid 
- problem with this is user experiense , when middleware redirect to login and check for auth it's show minor process on fronend for 500ms to 1.2second so here is user experinse is not good in my thinking , here also i don't know this is prefocessnel or normal to do 

3. backend request on interval
- i can create file which make call to backend on interval , like i set timest of 14m 55s to call backend for checking auth and backend create new token pair and delete old one 
- i think this is not bestpractice to do or this is not profeccenal to like google and apple 

## so all above is my requrment and problem and conser you now tell me whay should i do and how according to goal of archivment 

My strong opinion (short)
	•	Don’t do route-based refresh calls or blind polling. Use refresh-token rotation + proactive activity-based silent refresh + HttpOnly refresh cookie + short access tokens. That gives the best balance of security and frictionless UX. Implement single-inflight refresh + request queue on client to avoid races. Add MFA and session management for top-tier security.
